        summary: `**Summary of Article 1 (Definitions) – UAE Federal Nuclear Law**

Article 1 establishes key definitions for the application of the law, overriding conflicting definitions in other legislation. It clarifies:

- **State** refers to the UAE.
- **Authority** is the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation.
- **Operator** is any person licensed by the Authority to operate a nuclear facility, as per Federal Law No. 6 of 2009.
- **Nuclear Fuel** includes any material capable of energy generation via self-sustaining nuclear fission.
- **Radioactive Products or Waste** covers radioactive materials produced from nuclear fuel use or production, or materials rendered radioactive by exposure to such processes, excluding finished radioisotopes for scientific, medical, agricultural, commercial, or industrial use.
- **Nuclear Materials** comprise nuclear fuel (excluding natural and depleted uranium) capable of fission outside a reactor, and radioactive products/waste.
- **Nuclear Reactor** is any structure containing nuclear fuel arranged for self-sustaining fission without external neutron sources, excluding reactors used for propulsion in maritime or air transport.
- **Nuclear Facility** includes: (1) reactors not used for transport propulsion, (2) factories using or processing nuclear fuel/materials (including reprocessing), (3) storage facilities for nuclear materials (excluding those storing materials in transit), and (4) other facilities containing nuclear materials or waste as determined by the International Agency Board of Governors. Multiple facilities operated by one operator at a single location are considered one facility.
- **Nuclear Damages** encompass: death or personal injury; property loss/damage; economic losses not covered above; costs of environmental remediation (unless minor); loss of income from environmental use/enjoyment due to severe damage; costs and losses from precautionary measures; and other economic losses resulting from ionizing radiation from nuclear facilities, fuel, or waste, including toxic or explosive properties. The Cabinet may issue further instructions on these categories.
- **Nuclear Accident** means any incident or series of related incidents from a single origin causing, or threatening to cause, nuclear damages, including those requiring precautionary measures.
- **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)** are defined per IMF standards.
- **Vienna Convention of 1997** refers to the amended 1963 Vienna Convention and its protocol on civil liability for nuclear damages.

These definitions govern the interpretation and application of the law's provisions, including rights, obligations, and liabilities related to nuclear activities and incidents in the UAE.`,
